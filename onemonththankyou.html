            mi corizon y honeybeez,<br><br>

            what a month, i can't even describe how grateful i am for you.  words do this letter no justice.  i think it's crazy how we think we've done so much in a year, but we've conquered mountains and oceans in two weeks, and came back alive. together or time away, i am grateful for you. i love you and i miss you, dearly.  admittedly, i was going to scratch this whole project and throw away all the code to this, but what the fuck.  i love you.  i care about you and this is what i want to share with you.  here we go! here is to you and us, and all the love yous and thank yous:
        <br><br>
                + here's to us, for offering space; for learning and loving; for nothing more than doing our best<br>
                + for showing me your tears in santa catalina. being vulnerable with me made me realise i couldn't do what i was doing anymore.  not if i wanted us. thank you for you letting me know that you needed me to show up <br>
                + for dancing around the sun twice with me-- 25th/9th! i am lucky to love you<br>
                + for being the best love-seat lover, ever! on a jam packed bus back from santa catalina > panam치 city.  it was one of my favourite memories that i will never forget. as much as my ass was probably hurting your doy duas, i relished in your embrace as your arms were wrapped around my waist  <strong>squeeze! squeeze!</strong> <br>
                + for our conversations lately: at able seedhouse, on our 1-yr. date, in your bed, in my bed, in our emails and texts, around the lake, on the top of your neighbourhood hill, in the subaru, and on the phone-- i miss your voice so much<br>
                + for panam치: panam치 city, bocas del toro, boquete, santa catalina. and of course, you along the way, always.<br>
                + simply, for your love <br>
                + for selling your motobike in 2-3 days back from panam치! <br>
                + for helping me jump my car at seward and hugging me, and letting me wrap my arms and legs around you<br>
                + for encouraging me to go to therapy, and for engaging in the homework with me<br>
                + for communicating to me how i can best make you feel more loved in the coming days
            </p>
            <p class="thanks">
                and most of all, i love you.  my old self would've said, "i wish we could go back to the first couple months" but i don't we're here and this is what our love looks like right now.  it means it can only get better from here.  i know all i have is today to do better.  all i know is knowing that i love you.  my heart misses you so much.  i love you, storky, doy duas, mi sand칤a, and the sweetest sweetest honeybeez!  i wish i was sitting right across from you and looking into those big beautiful icelandic blue eyes and being able to tell you all this. (and unsticking your recently shaven ballsack. <strong>that was the most romantic thing you said to me this morning</strong>.)  thank you for everything, and for not allowing old unskillful patterns and entrenched limiting beliefs stop us from being better.
            </p>
            <p class="thanks">
            beez, i love you. you are my favourite human bean in the world, and i would cross worlds just to be in your arms.<br><br>
