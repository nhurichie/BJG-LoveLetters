            Dear Honeybee, <br><br>
            Thank you for explaining your confusion regarding an unsent love letter to you on our anniversary.  I had no idea you interpreted the lack of a letter as a sign of where our relationship was or at least where my mind might have been with the relationship.   It was far from that.  I did have a love letter.  I was unsure whether or not to send it.  I questioned if it would be too excessive since I had just sent one at the end of the March. Here is the un(SENT) love letter:

            Dear Beez (my favourite set of doy duas),                                       <br><br>

            I am so lucky to be able to do one full twirl around the sun with you! <strong>EEEEEHHHH!</strong> You make my cheeks hurt with all the smiles you put on my face, my heart full with all your love, and my soul alive because you have shown me what true love is.  I have so much I want to express to you, but I will keep it short and sweet! My words fail to tell you how much you mean to me, and maybe I don't need to put you into words.  I just know the first moment I laid eyes on you at mbp, and the secondtime thereafter on our first date, I had been waiting for you: mi coraz√≥n, mi humano.
            <br><br>
            Benjamin Jacob Gort, I love you. ‚ÄúHow‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt quite begin to describe it.  I love you in the quietest ways like the strength of your hands when they slip to fill the empty spaces of mine (<strong>squeeze! squeeze!</strong>); the curve of your mouth and your gentle lips when we kiss; your voice thick with sleep at 6am in the morning, when you're rolling over to hit snooze again and whispering softly all the "I love yous," just so we can remain entangled together a little longer-- and in these moments, I breathe a little deeper so I can take in your scent, snuggle closer to  you to feel the warmth of your body against mine because closeness is what my heart knows with you; and eventually, I know we'll open our eyes and smile at each other because I'm so close to you: forehead-to-forehead, nose-to nose.  It‚Äôs in the way you breathe, small sounds of longing.  I have so much of you in me, softly burning like a well kindled fire.  I love seeing the soft silhouette of your body in the moonlight, dappled shadows on your handsome face with my favourite moles during the smallest hours of the morning.  I love you. To love you is visceral.  <br><br>
            
             You are my mountains, moons, oceans, suns, stars, and the most important thing to me.  Thank you for going through another season with me, a growth pain that'll only makes us stronger together.  You have shown me the best kind of love and it is this: Ben does not discourage my growth; instead, my lover, my partner-in-crime, my best friend, sees me for who I am today, and cannot wait to see who I become tomorrow.  Thank you for this dance around the sun.  We hit 365 days of summer with sunshine and showers.  I could not and would not want to do it with anyone else but you!  Thank you for your relentless love and for chosing me, for choosing us.  I will always choose, you.  <br><br> 

             I can't wait to see you tonight and be each other's dates.  I hope you know how much you mean to me. <br>
             Ilysm, BJG, more than you'll ever know.
